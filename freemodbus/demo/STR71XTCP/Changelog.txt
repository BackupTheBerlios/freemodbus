 Notes: Fixed some bugs for the STR71/lwIP port in the lwIP and 
   system abstraction layer. In addition the FreeRTOS porting layer
   for lwIP was enhanced.

 Detailed notes:
   - FEATURES: implemented function to remove running tasks.
   - FEATURES: added new thread creation function in sys_arch.c which
       allows specifing the stack size.
   - BUGS: pppOpen defined in ppp.c does not check the return value of
       sys_thread_new. If task creation fails the system crashes.
   - BUGS: pppMain must not return - Instead it should remove its task
       from the scheduler.
